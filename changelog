just finished registration and login form so they work properly
added is_user_logged.php that will check if user is logged, and if its not it will redirect to login page
ok, so login and register form works fine, time for further steps
ok, for now simple chat is done,
i've edited login page
added user searching in left container
now when every user has a default avatar(0.jpg in avatars dir)
now im trying to make a social media like site, but idk if i'll need to make another site to do that cuz sometimes after sending message 2 containers dissapear(xD) and i think thats becouse of some js code that sets display: none; or display: flex; for those divs, need to check that
 
 
todo: 
-implement ajax;
-make site responsive;
-make some visual upgrades;
-still i need to make visual upgrades cuz its awful
