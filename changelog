just finished registration and login form so they work properly
added is_user_logged.php that will check if user is logged, and if its not it will redirect to login page
ok, so login and register form works fine, time for further steps
ok, for now simple chat is done,
i've edited login page
I managed to fix the bug that caused duplicate messages after refreshing the page

 
 
todo: 
-implement ajax;
-make site responsive(for now it is but thats not what i want);
-make some visual upgrades;
